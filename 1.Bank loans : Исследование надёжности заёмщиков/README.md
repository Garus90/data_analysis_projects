# Research of reliability of borrowers.
<b>Customer </b> - The credit department of the bank.  
<b>The task </b> - Determine whether the marital status and the number of children of the clients of the bank affects the fact of repaying the loan on time.  
<b>Input data from the bank </b>- statistics on the solvency of customers  
<b>Issues from customer:</b>
- Is there a correlation between the number of children and repayment of the loan on time?
- Is there a correlation between marital status and loan repayment on time?
